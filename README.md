# fuzzing-with-sanitizers
Tools, documentation and test inputs for fuzzing opensource projects with AddressSanitizer and friends.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to store fuzz test corpuses
for fuzzers such as [LLVM's LibFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)
or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) and how to setup up continuous fuzz testing process.

Stay tuned.
